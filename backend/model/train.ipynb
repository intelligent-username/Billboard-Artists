    "# Part 2: Model Exploration & Training\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be proceeding in 4 steps in order to see if the data we've collected has sufficient predictive power, moving from a less to a more complex model until we get diminishing returns. Keep in mind that, the series we create will need to be split by Artist, not by date, since we want predictions on artists we've never seen before, ultimately strongely based on network.\n",

    "## Phase 1: Naive Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-requisite: Plot the data just to see if there are any obvious trends between artist_past_performance and rank_norm. Note that in the \"preliminary analysis\", we saw that artists with more collaborations definetely tended to have better to rank better on debut, but this is just a correlation and the plotting in this step deals with a different feature.\n",
    "2. Baseline: Simple linear regression using artist_past_performance to predict rank_norm\n",
    "3. Experiment with 2nd, 3rd, and 5th degree polynomial regression using artist_past_performance to predict rank_norm\n",
    "4. Make residual plots of these fits with actual artist performance and see at what degree of polynomial we get diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Use Engineered Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use PageRank and Centrality scores, in addition to artist_past_performance and features_past_performance, to see if we can get better error reduction. If so, then we have reason to believe that there's stronger relationships between artists that can be exploited, in which case we can move on to proper graph-based neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 3: GNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct proper graph networks that use artist relationships as edges and artist features (PageRank, Centrality, past performance, etc) as node features. This is where the large chunk of work that we did on the graphing early on in the project will come in handy. We'll start making use of the transformed `JSON` relationship files\n",

    "## Phase 4: Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the accuracy for deployment.\n"
